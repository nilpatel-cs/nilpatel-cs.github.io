                        <p>I was accepted into the competitive Graduate Program at Queen’s College at Spring 2019 and began taking courses in July 2019. So far, I have taken “Discrete Math”, “Computer Organization and Assembly”, “Theory of Computation”, “Principles of Programming Languages” and “Algorithms” receiving A’s in every course.

                            One course I took “CS 320: Theory of Computation” is considered one of the most difficult and challenging required courses in the department, due to its abstract material, lead to a great opportunity. After I finished the course in the following semester, I was offered a position as a “Peer Mentor”, officially titled “HSI-Stem Research Assistant” I was chosen by the professor, Dr. Boklan, who chose former students who showed a strong understanding of the material and had exceptional grades. As a mentor, I did my best to help students understand the difficult material in my held office hours and by going over problems during recitation with students. We also held meetings with the professor discussing potential week points in students and ways to improve recitation and office hours. This was abruptly interrupted when the COVID-19 pandemic caused everything to have to be done remotely. I continued holding office hours via Google Meet and was able to assist many students study and prepare for a now more difficult class, I was also able to help facilitate the Professor’s transition to online teaching via a mock recitation consisting only of Mentors.

                    I was accepted into the competitive Graduate Program at Queen’s College at Spring 2019 and began taking courses in July 2019. So far, I have taken Discrete Math, Computer Organization and Assembly, Theory of Computation, Principles of Programming Languages, Algorithms, Distributed Computing and Numerical methods receiving A’s in every single course maintaining a 4.0 GPA to date. In the Principles of Programming Languages course I created a Stack-Based Machine that reads an input file and then performs the functions encoded with given parameters using a simulated runtime stack and memory stack and printing the results of the compuation to an output document. In distrubeted computing I created projects that implemented mutual exlusion using Java objects and methods as locks using the sychronized keyword to create monitors create a complex series of monitors to simulate going shopping at the height of the covid outbreak, I also further expanded this program by implementing it as a client server model in which each customer was a different client and the server would maintain mutual exclusion between clients. In Numerical Methods I learned to understand and design code for many algorithms that are used to calculate mathematical functions we take for granted, such as root finding using bisection, integration using Simpson's rule and differentiation using the sum of rectangles approximation

                    One course I took CS 320: Theory of Computation is considered one of the most difficult and challenging required courses in the department, due to its deeply abstract and theoretical material, my performance in this class lead to a great opportunity. After I finished the course in the following semester, I was offered a position as a Peer Mentor as an HSI-Stem Research Assistant. I was chosen by the professor, Dr. Boklan, who chose former students who showed a strong understanding of the material and had exceptional grades. As a mentor, I did my best to help students understand the difficult and nuanced material in office hours I held biweekly and by going over challenging problems during recitation with students. We also held meetings with the professor discussing potential weak points in student's comphrehension of the material and what we coudl do to improve there grasp of the material. This was abruptly interrupted when the COVID-19 pandemic peaked, moving the rest of the semester to remote learning. After a brief recalibration period I continued holding office hours via Google Meet remotely and helped students grasp the material and work through the problems in a now more complicated learning situation. I was also able to help facilitate the Professor’s transition to online teaching via a mock recitation consisting only of Mentors.
