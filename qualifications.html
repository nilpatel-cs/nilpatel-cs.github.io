                            I received Bachelor’s Degree from St. John’s University with Honors, in Computer Science and a minor in Philosophy. The curriculum was mostly focused on learning fundamental programming concepts and establishing a strong foundation in object-oriented design. A majority of my course were in Java, but some branched out into other languages like C++, MySQL and Prolog. I learned not only how to code but also to plan out and thoroughly test my own work, building a habit of unit testing and regression testing to produce better cleaner code.

                            Outside of Computer Science, I had a very well-rounded experience as an undergraduate student. Academically I was a member of the St John’s University Honors Program, a program that only accepts 350 incoming freshman each year, I was a member of the National Philosophy Honors Society and was also invited to join the Physics Honor Society. I had taken many different courses completing a minor in Philosophy taking courses in logic as well as almost graduating with a double major in Physics. 
                            I also learned two languages taking both Japanese and Chinese during my time at St. John’s.

                            Outside of academics, I was the group leader of a campus group known as “Duel Society” where I acted both as a mediator and advisor to the members of the group, while also organizing tournaments on campus and trips to official events off campus. In addition to being the leader of “Duel Society” I was a member of the Otaku-Brigade a St. John’s club in which I was a Committee Head who was in charge of facilitating a monthly movie night and eventually a member of the organizations E-board as an Event Coordinator in which I was in charge of logistics of larger campus events in which we collaborated with other Universities, events which generated large revenues for future events.

                            Throughout my undergraduate career I was often a leader in group projects and labs. In earlier classes I would finish lab assignments quickly often having classmates ask for assistance or the professor handing me extra coding challenges to fill my time during class. When we started more advanced classes with team labs and projects my peers would look to me to organize and help set guidelines for our project and inevitably find bugs in their code. I’m proud to say I was able to meet every deadline never submitting non-functioning code.

                            <li>Operating Systems: A “Car Simulator” which implemented multithreading using Java’s concurrent class and reentrant locks to concurrently “drive”, “add gas” and “get gas”.</li>
                            <li>Software Engineering: A large team project in consisting of about 20 students working in collaboration using GitHub, I was put in charge of various tasks over the course of the semester using MySQL, Java and Swing; I performed Unit Test’s for all code uploaded by other members, added code for MySQL integration with Java methods and towards the end when my tasks were complete assisted other group members in producing functional code, the whole time practicing professional regression testing pulling and testing the code before pushing to the main branch.</li>

Dr. Boklan chose me as one of the peer mentors for his spring class, as a result of showing a strong understanding of the course material and receiving a good grade in the class. CS 320 is a very difficult course for most students because of its very conceptual nature it requires a strong grasp of the ideas and concepts to succeed. My goal as a peer mentor was too help students reach that strong level of understanding and help them succeed in the course. As a peer mentor, I held biweekly office hours in which students would come in and review problems and concepts, furthermore I was required to attend class sessions and help students with challenge problems during class in an effort to help students get more comfortable with approaching the problems. When Queens College shifted to online learning I had to continue in my capacity as a peer mentor remotely, holding office hours virtually via google meets. I found that Peer Mentoring was a very rewarding experience further solidifying my own understanding of concepts I learned in the same course as I had to convey them to the students who came to me for help.
